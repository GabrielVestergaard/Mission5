        The club was founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club and became Manchester United in 1902. Under legendary managers such as Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, United built a tradition centered on attacking football, youth development, and resilience. Old Trafford, famously nicknamed the “Theatre of Dreams” by Busby, has hosted countless historic moments and remains one of the most iconic stadiums in world sport.
